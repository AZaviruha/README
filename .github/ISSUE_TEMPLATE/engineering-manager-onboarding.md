name: Engineering Manager Onboarding
about: A list of things to do as a new manager to become familiar with the nature of our engineering team and the context it exists in.

## After your first week

You’ve done general people-ops and engineering team onboarding, and have casually met some team members. Now it’s time to start onboarding as a new engineering manager.

- [ ] If you’re reading this, you’re the first external engineering manager we’ve hired and your name is Adam. Yay! (If not, this will be _real_ awkward.)

     At Artsy we are trying to give new hires ownership over improving the onboarding documentation that they are faced with, in an effort to help the next new hire onboard more smoothly. As you are the first one, there is plenty of work to do in this area; in fact, this very document is nothing but a first draft. Things in this document may turn out to be insufficient, too broad, or simply not work at all. That’s all good and you should feel empowered to bring this up openly.

     It will be your task to improve [this document](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/engineering-manager-onboarding.md), drawing from all the things you’ve had to learn. You’re not on your own, your fellow peers will all be available to support you during this task. You got this!

- [ ] The people-ops team should have signed you up for the various on-site manager trainings.

- [ ] Your manager should have invited you to meetings relevant to managers.

- [ ] Your manager should have scheduled 1:1s for you with the other engineering managers, including the CTO, and other leadership people.

- [ ] While already mentioned in the previous onboarding checklist, it bears repeating for you as a manager that you should internalize [Artsy’s Values](/culture/what-is-artsy.md#artsy-values) and our [Engineering Principles](/culture/engineering-principles.md).

## Your first ~two months

The goal of onboarding is to set you up for success as a new engineering manager at Artsy. To that end, your main objective during this time will be to gather knowledge and context. You will be given ample time to get acquainted with your new peers, our business, our tech, and our strategies that bind them all together.

_For now we’ll try to target roughly two months, as there are currently 5 product teams and sprints have a duration of 2 weeks. Whether or not this duration was too arbitrary is something we’ll have to learn._

To help work on the main objective, we’ve tried to identify the following goals.

### Get to know Artsy's engineering team

- [ ] Have 1:1s with each and every engineer (that includes tech-leads) to get to know the people, their interests, their north-star goals, and their perspectives on the businesses they contribute to. (It is likely easiest for coordination to do this with the people of the product team that you’re rotated on at the time.)

- [ ] While working with individual contributors and during your 1:1s, try to develop an understanding of where and how you want to add value as a manager.

- [ ] Keep a continuous and open discussion going with your peer managers about opportunities for people you think you could manage and why. By the end of sprint rotation we should organically have arrived at a set of suggestions that we, as the entire engineering team, can _consider_.

### Get to know Artsy's tech

- [ ] Unlike individual contributors, who rotate teams for a few sprints to gain a general understanding of how we work as contributors, engineering managers are expected to rotate across _all_ the teams to gain the understanding needed to successfully support their reports in achieving their goals and growth. (For example, unblocking people by knowing how to achieve something or who/where to delegate to, facilitate discussions by understanding context and who to involve for a given topic; and how to set expectations for engineers, product, and business owners as to what is realistically achievable.) Tech-leads and PMs should have been made aware of your main objective and provide you with time to do so.

- [ ] By the end of your sprint rotation, put together a short presentation on a TBD topic. (See [this thread](https://github.com/artsy/README/pull/95#discussion_r228900278) for previous discussion on this topic.)

### Get to know Artsy's business

- [ ] Have 1:1s with business owners to make your acquaintance and gain an understanding of what the landscape in their piece of the business looks like in general and how our technology uniquely fuels our take on it.

- [ ] Have 1:1s with PMs to gain an understanding of how product and engineering work together to produce results in their respective parts of the business.

- [ ] TBD: Flesh out: go to a gallery and auction. Besides being fun, what could they learn from doing this and in what way should they do so? E.g. shadow a liaison, casually visit?

### Help the team get to know you

- [ ] Work on improving and expanding this nimble `README` repository to both gain an understanding [from both the existing docs and from speaking to people] of how we have been communicating _and_ to help shape our communication going forward.

- [ ] As an engineering manager, hiring will become one of your top-priorities. To familiarize yourself with the process and the people involved you should be the hiring manager for at least one candidate and be a fly on the wall during an interview and a reference call. TBD: We have some disparate google docs on hiring, we should figure out exactly what (compiled) resource to link to for this item.

- [ ] Get to know our team processes and help us learn from your experiences.
    - [ ] Run an [engineering team standup](/events/open-standup.md).
    - [ ] Present a [Lunch & Learn](/events/lunch-and-learn.md) session on something you’re familiar with from your previous role.
    - [ ] _If_ the opportunity arises and somebody needs drop their shift, take a turn in our [support rotation](/playbooks/support.md) sooner rather than later.

## Beyond sprint rotation

The onboarding period is over and you’re settling in. Ah yes, you did it!

- [ ] Now comes the time to _jointly_ finalize the group of reports you should take on. Besides that this should be an ongoing and open discussion all throughout the onboarding period, the exact process of how to come to this group of reports is still totally TBD. The only thing to keep in mind is that during onboarding you should be able to focus on the objectives of onboarding and not have less time to focus on those for the last sprint of your product team rotation by being preoccupied with determining reports.

- [ ] Now is a good time to be involved in broader operational tasks, as they are excellent opportunities to talk to more diverse stake-holders. For example:
    - [ ] Write a post-mortem.
    - [ ] Work on `TODO` items that have come out of retros.
