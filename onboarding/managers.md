## Onboarding For Managers

### Before Day 1

- [ ] Choose a peer mentor for the new hire
- [ ] Choose a spirit guide for the new hire (consult with People Ops)
- [ ] Create an onboarding github issue in this repo based on the onboarding template.
- [ ] Set first-week schedule
- [ ] Invite new hire to all engineering-wide meetings
- [ ] Determine [sprint rotation plan](/onboarding/sprint-rotation.md)

### Day 1

- [ ] Organize lunch outing (probably to Tataki!)
- [ ] Give an overview of what the onboarding will look like. This is a good time to walk through the onboarding template.
- [ ] Introduce new hire to their mentor
- [ ] When they are set up with slack, invite them to relevant channels

### Week 1

- [ ] Schedule a check-in towards the end of the week

### And onward!

- [ ] When the new hire is assigned to an initial product team, work with the PM/tech lead of that team to make sure they are set up and invited to all relevant meetings.
- [ ] Remind tech leads/PMs that are part of the sprint rotation to prepare resources and invite new hire to meetings
