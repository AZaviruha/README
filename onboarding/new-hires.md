# Onboarding

You have hopefully been onboarded by our people team. You have a mentor and a spirit guide. You now know where we
keep the snacks! You probably have a computer that's plugged in and have set some things up. Awesome.

Now, it's time to learn about our engineering team-- who we are and how we operate. We've broken this down into two
pieces:

1. [An introduction to our team](/onboarding/engineering-introduction.md)
2. A guide for getting started. Your manager should have created a github issue for you based on our
   [onboarding template](https://github.com/artsy/potential/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/engineering-onboarding.md),
   and even a second one based on our
   [manager onboarding template](https://github.com/artsy/potential/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/engineering-manager-onboarding.md)
   if youâ€™re a new engineering manager. If you find issues, please submit a pull request to update the template!

Feel free to start poking around. Your manager will walk you through these documents on your first day, and you'll
enlist them help of them, your mentor, and everyone else on the team to get through the checklist embedded in the
guide.
