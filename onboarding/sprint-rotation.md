## Sprint Rotation

After an engineer has gone through basic onboarding (setting up systems, etc.) which will last about a week, they may spend a few sprints switching between different teams.

### Why a sprint rotation?

When engineers begin at Artsy, we want them to develop an understanding of our systems and business at a pace that fits their current experience. There's a lot of information to absorb and when engineers start on a product team with immediate sprint goals, there's often not the time or space to learn about the many facets of Artsy.

The sprint rotation is an attempt to mitigate that worry, and also make onboarding/mentorship a shared responsibility. If an engineer switches teams at the start of a new quarter, they should be able to consume the same documentation or expertise that a team has developed for the sprint rotation.

#### Goals
- Get up-to-speed on Artsy's systems by being part of different product teams.
- Learn about different sides of Artsy's business in a first-hand way.
- Get to know our engineering team and how different engineers and teams work.

### How does the sprint rotation work?

A new engineer's manager will work with tech leads to determine the proper length of the sprint rotation and which teams will be involved. This process can be used for the sole purpose of onboarding, and/or to help choose which team the new engineer will start on full-time.

Following the sprint rotation, the new engineer will join a team full-time.

#### Before the rotation starts
- Manager schedules the duration and content of the sprint rotation, being cognizant of factors like:
  - Other team members also going through sprint rotation
  - Schedule of tech leads/PMs
  - Specific areas of interest for new engineer
- Manager makes sure the tech lead/PM are aware (well in advance) of the upcoming rotation.

#### Before the sprint starts
_Manager responsibilities:_
- The week before the new sprint starts, make sure the new engineer is set up to meet with the tech lead of the team for the upcoming sprint (and if they are available, the PM).

_New engineer responsibilities:_
- Engineer attends sprint planning for the team they'll be rotating onto.
- Pending time, the engineer can get their dev environment set up with any additional systems.
- Pending time, the engineer can browse the team's documentation and current sprint projects.

_Tech lead/PM responsibilities:_
- Meet with the new engineer to discuss the focus for the upcoming sprint and help them get acquainted or onboarded with any team processes or systems.
- Add the engineer to all team meetings _just for that sprint_. This includes standups, knowledge shares, retros, and the sprint planning for the assigned sprint (which will likely occur the week before).
- Make sure the backlog has a healthy number of `good-first-issue` tickets that can be picked up during the sprint.
- Let the team know that the sprint rotation will be happening so they are prepared to pair on tasks and feel comfortable explicitly scheduling that if necessary.
- Invite the new engineer to necessary slack user groups and/or google groups for the team.

#### During the sprint
- Engineer will pair on critical sprint tasks with members of the team.
- Engineer will work on non-blocking small tasks (i.e. those [tagged with](https://artsyproduct.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20good-first-issue) `good-first-issue`), pairing with their mentor or members of the team if necessary.
