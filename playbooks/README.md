### How to do particular tasks at Artsy

# Goals of these documents

These "playbooks" were inspired by [Thoughtbot's playbook](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook), as well as internal
discussions of ways for Artsy's engineering team to share a common vision and hard-won lessons internally. It aims
to make good decisions easy, leaving plenty of space for experiments and even radical departures, but improving
consistency where helpful. Rather than a set of policies for everyone to conform to, it's here to:

- Help refine our own thinking
- Create a forum for future discussion and iteration
- Establish shared vocabulary
- Offer a framework when it's desired

This is a living document--a perpetual work in progress as we acquire new experiences, struggle through
post-mortems, and experiment with new approaches. _You_ are the co-author, so when you're convinced a new tool or
practice should be incorporated, submit a PR!
