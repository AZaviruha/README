# Jira

We use [Jira](https://artsyproduct.atlassian.net/) as a common tool for managing product work. Each team works
within a "project."

## Kanban stages/columns

Our workflow takes Jira issues through these stages:

| Name:     | Define                                                                      | Ready                                                                                    | In Progress              | Review                                                | Merged                                       | Monitoring             | Done                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Criteria: | Further definition or requirements needed before engineering work can begin | Requirements, priority, and high-level design are established enough that work can begin | Actively being developed | Pull request submitted and being reviewed or improved | Merged and deployed to staging; ready for QA | Deployed to production | Confirmed to work as expected in production; any data has been collected; clean-up complete (no further tracking necessary) |

## Types of Jira issues

- **Epics** should be _goal_ oriented
- **Stories** should be _impact_ oriented
- **Subtasks** (when necessary) should be _release_ oriented, usually corresponding to pull requests
