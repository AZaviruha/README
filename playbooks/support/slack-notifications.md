## Slack Notifications for Incidents

- Make sure "do not disturb" is turned off on your Phone itself. e.g. you canâ€™t see red on the side of your iPhone
  in that switch.
- Open slack on iOS
- Swipe from right to left in your conversation, then go to Settings
- Go to "Notifications"
- Scroll to "Channel Specific Notifications"
- Set incidents to be on all messages

## Validating it works

- Go to "Troubleshooting Notifications" in the Notifications setting
- This will send you a notification, which should make a noise
