# Happy Hours at Artsy

Happy Hours are a long-standing event at Artsy where employees get together and invite our partners, family, friends,
artists and fellow engineers. It was inspired by the happy hour at Artsy's first office in the co-working space of
General Assembly in 2010 and remained a tradition ever since.

We run happy hours once a month on the first Friday of every month except in the summer, when it is a Thursday.

Happy Hour is held inside our offices, on a weekly basis. We strive to make them full of interesting people across the
tech & arts spectrum. Other than friends we tend to invite great candidates that we might not be currently interviewing, but
maybe will consider in the future, or that we believe could use some help networking with fellow engineers.

There are small snacks, drinks (including beer, wine, whiskey, etc.). We have a bartender.

The best way to get invited is to engage with one of our team members through open-source work or social media.

If you have been invited, welcome!
