title: Artsy Learns to Code
description: Experimental structure where we teach non-engineering colleagues how to code.

Original discussion of the timeline and scope can be
[found on Slack](https://artsy.slack.com/archives/CCZT718UW/p1542732258011800).

Let's offer a way for non-engineering Artsy staff to learn how to code. Since our entire business is built on code,
it's helpful for our colleagues to have a working vocabulary and understanding of what we do.
[In the past](http://artsy.github.io/series/swift-at-artsy/), our colleagues have learned enough to understand what
we mean when we say "there was a bug in a dependency" or "the callback wasn't executing"; these are phrases we use
and understand implicitly, but they _are_ specific to Engineering. _Artsy Learns to Code_ is also a way for
engineers to mentor more junior colleagues.

## Abstract

The project will see _learners_ (non-engineering Artsy staff) paired off together and assigned to a _mentor_ (an
Artsy Engineer). Over the course of January–April 2019, learners will:

- Take a course in JavaScript [from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803), with
  support from mentors.
- Define a small project they'd like to build with the Artsy APIs.
- Build an minimum-viable-product and present at [Demo Days](./demo-days.md).

## Structure

_Artsy Learns to Code_ will be structured in two parts:

- 2 months of learning JavaScript through the
  [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803).
  - 7 lessons = 1 lesson / week \* 1 week wiggle room.
- 2 months of creating a project.
  - Or however long it takes, some might finish early.

The Udacity course does _not_ teach about React or HTML or any of the things necessary to build the project – it
just teaches JavaScript fundamentals. Our hypothesis is that learners will be able to succeed, given: a firm grasp
of these fundamentals, a scaffold with necessary libraries like React already set up, a brief team-wide
introduction to React, and help from mentors

We'll have trios: one mentor and two learners, who will be partners throughout _Artsy Learns to Code_.

## Expectations of Learners

- 2+ hours a week to dedicate to taking the course and handling course work. Ideally you do this with you partner.
  Once you complete the course, this time will be dedicated to working on the project.
- Meeting with your assigned mentor for a one-hour weekly check-in. Bring your questions and make sure to get
  answers from your engineer before you leave.
- This will be a difficult experience.
  [You will struggle; that's normal](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/normalizing-struggle/). We're here to help, but we
  can't do the work for you. Learning to code is like learning an instrument: it takes dedicated, repeated
  practice. But that's all it takes.

## Expectations of Mentoring Engineers

- Be available for a one-hour weekly check-in with the pair of learners. Your job is to keep them on the Udacity
  course schedule. Once they finish the course, you'll be responsible for helping them build their project. - The
  project will vary from group to group, but we're going to start out with a common scaffolding that already
  includes Palette, API access, etc. This scaffolding will be hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com). If the
  learners need something extra (ex: MapBox integration), then getting that set up to unblock them would be a
  responsibility of yours.
- Make sure to reassure learners that struggling is normal and that, even if they don't understand everything now,
  they should focus on what they _do_ understand and be comfortable not knowing how it all works.
- Make sure not to do the project _for_ the learners. Helping is totally okay, and expected, but always try to pair
  if you can.
