title: Artsy Learns to Code v2
description: Second iteration on ALTC
---

See the original ALTC write-up [here](./artsy-learns-to-code.md) for the previous iteration's abstract and
structure.

## Abstract

Let's kick off another session of Artsy Learns to Code!

## Motivations for ALTC v2

- It's social! Lets Artsy people interact across their normal silos
- Build empathy across Artsy
- It's fun! Boosts morale
- Empowers non-technical people
- Gets engineers used to teaching regularly

## Features

- Learners can opt to specify different areas of engineering/CS they'd like to learn about. We'll do our best to
  accomodate these requests, but won't guarantee that we can match mentors' expertises with learners' requests.
- If students don't have a specific idea for what they'd like to learn (which is totally ok!), we have a default
  suggested teaching plan: p5.js aka Processing in JS.

## Structure

Similar to the previous ALTC, we'll have trios: one mentor and two learners, who will be partners throughout _Artsy
Learns to Code_.

As a default course, we'll recommend p5.js, a direct JS port of Processing. We hope that working with p5.js will be
more engaging than a course on vanilla JS. It also embodies the Artsy value _Art x Science_.

We'll start with this youtube tutorial, which is taught by a professor at NYU's ITP (Interactive Telecommunications
Program):

In an effort to keep attendance up and keep learners motivated, we won't enforce a schedule that all learners
should be following. Instead, groups can set their own cadence and work on a schedule that works for them.

Then groups can decide on what they might want to make with p5.js, and mentors can guide them.

### Some Core Competencies We Could Aim Teach

- Fundamentals:
  - Syntax
  - Data types & Variables
  - Conditionals
  - Functions
  - Loops
  - Arrays
  - Objects
- Web Development:
  - What is a library/package?
  - How does JS/CSS/HTML interact with each other?
  - What is a server? A client?
- More General Software Development:
  - Algorithms
  - Classes/OOP
  - SQL

## Expectations of Learners

- Passion to learn and try something new
- An open mind
- (Optional) Come with an idea of what they want to learn

## Expectations of Mentoring Engineers

- Mentors should expect to spend 1-2 hrs a week of their time to meet regularly and answer questions async on slack
- Mentors should feel empowered to come up with their own teaching plan (and ideally share it with the rest of the
  mentors!). Note: mentors should consider the extra time required to craft their own teaching plan.
- Act as a resource for when learners have questions
- Act as a motivator for when learners get frustrated
  - Normalize frustration (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYjPBcqo1-s)
- If mentor group agrees to go the route of learning Processing.js, then the mentor should try to familiarize
  themselves with p5js, or at least follow along with the course.
