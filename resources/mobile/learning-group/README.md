## Session One

This week, we will cover how iOS software is developed, QA'd, and deployed. By the end of this session, all
participants should be able to pull the latest code from Eigen and Emission, see their work in an iOS simulator,
and link the two projects together.

[Materials are here](./session-one.md).
