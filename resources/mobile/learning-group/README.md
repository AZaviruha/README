## Session One

This week, we will cover how iOS software is developed, QA'd, and deployed. By the end of this session, all
participants should be able to pull the latest code from Eigen and Emission, see their work in an iOS simulator,
and link the two projects together.

[Materials are here](./session-one.md).

## Session Two

This week, we will cover what makes React Native distinct from React on the web, as well as how Artsy leverages
shared infrastructure (such as Palette) to make it easier for engineers to work in either one.

[Materials are here](./session-two.md).
