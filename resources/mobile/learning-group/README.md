## Session One

This week, we will cover how iOS software is developed, QA'd, and deployed. By the end of this session, all
participants should be able to pull the latest code from Eigen and Emission, see their work in an iOS simulator,
and link the two projects together.

[Materials are here](./session-one.md).

## Session Two

This week, we will cover what makes React Native distinct from React on the web, as well as how Artsy leverages
shared infrastructure (such as Palette) to make it easier for engineers to work in either one.

[Materials are here](./session-two.md).

## Session Three

This week, we will cover how to create a new view controller. View controllers are the main unit of composition for
native iOS apps, and we integrate our "Scene" React components as view controllers. This includes routing between
view controller, from both native Objective-C and React Native code.

## Session Four

This week, we will create our own React component to fit within the new view controller from Week 3. This will be a
Relay container, fetching data from Metaphysics v2. We will cover how to fetch data, how to re-fetch data, as well
as how Eigen and Emission integrate together to provide client-side API response caches (both Relay and others).
