Xcode is Apple's IDE for developing, among many other things, iOS applications. You can install Xcode in one of two
ways:

- [From the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [From Apple's Developer portal üîê](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)

Either works, but beware! If you have App Store automatic updates enabled, you may come in to work one day and find
that your IDE has changed (which has implications for Swift language and SDK versions). If you ever need a specific
version of Xcode, check out [Apple's Developer portal üîê](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/).

Xcode is really different from VSCode. It's Apple's opinion on what a good IDE should be, and sometimes it's
uncomfortable at first. Some quick differences:

- Xcode doesn't encourage you to have multiple files open at a time, in tabs.
- Xcode uses web browser-like history for navigating back-and-forth between files (look at the top-right corner of
  the file editor for the arrows).
- Xcode's file browser doesn't represent the file system's directory structure ‚Äì it is a distinct organization that
  just _happens_ to match the disk's directory structure most of the time.
