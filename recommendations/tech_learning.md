# Tech Learning
We often hear that learning to google (or perhaps [DuckDuckGo](www.duckduckgo.com)) and use stack overflow is are the most important core competencies of any programmer, but growth and learning happen best outside the vacuum of the internet. This page is a list of the engineering team's favorite resources -tutorials, essays, starting points and general thoughts- on a variety of programming topics. 

This is a living document; if you find something out of date or have an addition please open a pull request.
